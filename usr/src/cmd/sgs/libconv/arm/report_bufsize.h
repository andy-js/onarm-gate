/*
 * This file was generated by libconv_mk_report_bufsize,
 * from the libconv Makefile.
 *
 * Many of the buffer types defined in sgs/include/conv.h are defined
 * as a fixed integer rather than using the actual size calculation that
 * would take the lengths of all the possible strings into consideration.
 * The code that implements the conversion function does the proper
 * calculation. It is important that these two values be the same.
 *
 * It is done this way because:
 *
 *	(1) The size calculation uses message length values only available
 *		within the file that implements the conversion function.
 *	(2) Separating the size calculation from the code that uses it
 *		would increase the odds of not updating both, and is
 *		therefore more error prone.
 *
 * If the public size in conv.h and the real size computed by the
 * implementing module are not the same, memory corruption or wasted
 * space will result. Therefore, the code is supposed to contain a
 * preprocessor check that refuses to compile if they don't. This
 * is easy to do, but when the sizes do not match, it can be tedious
 * to determine the right size to set the conv.h value to. This file
 * is used to help with that.
 *
 * Example: Suppose the external size declared in conv.h is
 * CONV_DYN_FLAG_BUFSIZE, and the internal computed value based
 * on the actual strings is FLAGSZ. The module would use the following
 * to ensure they match:
 *
 *	#if CONV_DYN_FLAG_BUFSIZE != FLAGSZ
 *	#define REPORT_BUFSIZE FLAGSZ
 *	#include "report_bufsize.h"
 *	#error "CONV_DYN_FLAG_BUFSIZE does not match FLAGSZ"
 *	#endif 
 *
 * In the error case, report_bufsize.h is included. It will use a #warning
 * preprocessor directive to show the current value of the REPORT_BUFSIZE
 * macro. The programmer will therefore see a message giving the correct
 * size of the value that should be defined in conv.h, followed by a
 * #error line telling them which constant is at fault.
